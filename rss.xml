            <title><![CDATA[Americano + croissant from Nektar Caf√©ologue Qu√®bec City, QC. Oct. 10, 2015 The aroma of blueberries struck me first in this sweet espresso from @SocialCoffee. A Sidama Ardi Espresso, it comes from the Guji region of Ethiopia. The coffee was even more sweet and flavourful than the aroma. One thing I love about Nektar is their rolling selection of roasters and their expertly pulled shots. #Coffee #Cafe #Caffeine #Quebec #Food #Drink #CaffeineAddict #Travel]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Pour Over at @ElixrCoffee Philadelphia, PA. Taken Dec 26, 2014. I was so ecstatic when I found out this place had 2 pacamara micro lots from Arturo Aguirre's Finca El Injerto. The coffee was light and clean with notes of white grapes, nutmeg and cream. A real treat. "Finca El Injerto is a legendary estate located in Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The estate was founded in 1874 and since 2002, has produced multiple bourbon coffee lots that have been awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence. More recently, it has also tendered pacamara coffee lots that were awarded first place, for three consecutive years in the international competition of that event. Finca El Injerto has the good fortune of being in the exact altitude and micro-climate to grow outstanding coffees." #Coffee #GoodGrinds #Cafe #CupOfExcellence #Caffeine #Coffee_Inst #CoffeeAddict #CoffeeLover #Philly]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Americanos from @BreadAndSons Ottawa, ON. Taken Dec 20, 2014. This place pulls amazing shots using @49th and has the best breakfast sandwiches EVER! The barista here could tell, just by looking, one of the americanos was pulled to quickly. While they offered to re-pull, we decided to keep it as a fun tasting experiment. This place is a MUST on Brian's Ottawa ‚òïÔ∏è list. #Coffee #Caffeine #Espresso #Ottawa #Cafe #CoffeeSesh #Coffee_Inst #CoffeeTime #CoffeeAddict]]></title>

I love opportunities to actually sit and enjoy their coffee at their original caf√© on Harbord St. This roast has notes of dates, raspberry jam and Reese's pieces.
