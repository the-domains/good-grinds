title: "Americano - @49th - Vancouver, BC - Oct. 22, 2015. This roaster and café just screams \"Vancouver\" to me. Their coffee is delicious and unique and very consistent. Nothing beats having it made right at the flagship store though. It was also listed in @buzzfeed's \"Yop 25 Cafés in the World You Have to Visit Before You Dir.\" This ☕️ made with Epic Espresso was bright and vibrant without being sour or to shocking to the pallet. #Coffee #Cafe #Caffeine #InstaCoffee #Vancouver #BC #Canada #Coffee_Inst"
