title: "Two Americanos from @BreadAndSons Ottawa, ON. Taken Dec 20, 2014. This place pulls amazing shots using @49th and has the best breakfast sandwiches EVER! The barista here could tell, just by looking, one of the americanos was pulled to quickly. While they offered to re-pull, we decided to keep it as a fun tasting experiment. This place is a MUST on Brian's Ottawa ☕️ list. #Coffee #Caffeine #Espresso #Ottawa #Cafe #CoffeeSesh #Coffee_Inst #CoffeeTime #CoffeeAddict"
