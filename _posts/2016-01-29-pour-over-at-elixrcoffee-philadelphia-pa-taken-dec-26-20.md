title: "Pour Over at @ElixrCoffee Philadelphia, PA. Taken Dec 26, 2014. I was so ecstatic when I found out this place had 2 pacamara micro lots from Arturo Aguirre's Finca El Injerto. The coffee was light and clean with notes of white grapes, nutmeg and cream. A real treat. \"Finca El Injerto is a legendary estate located in Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The estate was founded in 1874 and since 2002, has produced multiple bourbon coffee lots that have been awarded the prestigious Cup of Excellence. More recently, it has also tendered pacamara coffee lots that were awarded first place, for three consecutive years in the international competition of that event. Finca El Injerto has the good fortune of being in the exact altitude and micro-climate to grow outstanding coffees.\" #Coffee #GoodGrinds #Cafe #CupOfExcellence #Caffeine #Coffee_Inst #CoffeeAddict #CoffeeLover #Philly"
